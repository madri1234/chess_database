It includes tables for players, tournaments, matches, and Elo rating changes, designed with a relational structure to track player performance, match results, and tournament history. The project leverages SQL joins and complex subqueries to perform detailed analyses, such as calculating winning percentages, head-to-head comparisons, Elo rating trends, and country-wise performance. This database structure enables insights into player achievements, match outcomes, and overall chess statistics, providing a valuable resource for chess data analysis and strategic insights.
